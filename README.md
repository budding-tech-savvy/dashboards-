# dashboards-

This is global superstore data fetched from the well-known website Kaggle. after downloading this dummy or raw data. the most significant task is to clean our data. 
one question certainly is coming in each budding illustrator .how to clean the data. you are aware of MX excel a little bit. then definitely you must be aware of 
the power query editor.  the power query editor is that feature of excel by which you can clean up or transform your data .whatever changes you want to bring easily 
might be added through the power query editor. the extension of this file is of the power bi tool. here,  I have tried to create an attractive dashboard..in this data 
cleaning process, many needy columns were not present then extra columns were incorporated by flushing the data .and also I have put too much endeavor to brush off 
unwanted and redundant columns. the most time-consuming process is to wash out the unorganized data .in this grueling cleaning process, I have inserted some columns. 
the name of such columns is delivery days, returns, and years.
while inserting these all columns I had to apply some conditions such as if conditions and formula also used to find out years from the order date column.
after getting the tidy and evident data, the most important task begins such as making a pictorial representation of your raw data....in this star-studded illustration.
many visualizations and analyses have been done. and I have introduced a lot of questions that are coming into my skull. such questions are:-
1. calculate the average delivery days for any products 
2. figure  out the  total count of returned products 
3. top five  profitable customers' names 
4. top five profitable products 
in drawing up this representation I have availed of a wide variety of charts and maps. such charts and maps are 
1. pie chart:-  has been used to mark the sum of sales by segment
2. donut chart:-has been  included to know the sum of sales by market
3. stacked bar charts have been added to know the top five customers who have contributed too much profit.:-
4. line and clustered column charts -have been used to determine the top five products in profit.
5. map"-used to showcase the name  of the region and the sum of the number of products
I have used some formatting features to make it so scintillating.
